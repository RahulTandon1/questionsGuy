Hi! I'm questionsGuy!
I help store and recall quiz and crossword questions so you can quickly go through questions
before interschool competitinos, right from your discord server!

Here are all the commands you can run:

$makeQ to start making a new question
$question to set the value of the question
$answer to set the value of the answer
$type to set value of question type (usually question or answer)
$saveQ to save the current question
$yes to confirm to save question, when asked
$help to ask for help
$getQs <type> <max limit> to get Questions stored in DB. Type can be either 'quiz' or 'cross'
and max limit needs to be a number. If you don't specify type and maxLimit, the command won't work 
and will cause an error
