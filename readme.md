Current Status:
A hacky implementation of a discord bot that stores questions (see helpMessage.txt for me details)

plan
- implement this in python with a cleaner and more readable structure so that i can present this in school. 
- integrate this with google docs, so that it either. 
    - updates the doc the moment a question is added
    - doc has a menu that pops up / tool that pops up and informs the user that new questions are available and has a button to insert them. 
- implementation of the previous point can/might go about this way:
    - Implement the Chatbot in python // full thing
    Get all the same functionality set up, by using the python alternative to discord.js, with a cleaner and more readable 'code base'. 

    - Get Google Docs to add stuff // quick implementatino to get stuff working
    get google to add stuff from db using django for backend and appscript for front end OR check and see if one can get a direct db connection with apps script and look for new documents in the mongo db

    - Small scale quick integration
    Make a small app that has a single command and use it to change the doc

    - Full scale implementation.
